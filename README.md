# Fine Tuning a BERT Classification Model
### By Emi Planchon

In this repository, I document and walkthrough my process of fine tuning a pretrained BERT classification model to complete sentiment analysis on a Rotten Tomatoes dataset. I wanted to use this project as an opporunity to better familiarize myself with Hugging Face and their Transformers package. Similarly, I was eager to gain some experience in fine tuning some popular transformer models, as this framework can be applied to different types of langauge models, including GPT2 and GPT3.
